    "RAG1": {
        "Q": "What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and how does it enhance AI-Generated Content (AIGC)?", 
        "Ans": "RAG is a paradigm that integrates information retrieval into the generative process of AI models. It enhances AIGC by retrieving relevant data from external sources, leading to improved accuracy, robustness, and up-to-date content generation."
    },
    "RAG2": {
        "Q": "What are the key limitations of RAG systems?", 
        "Ans": "The major limitations of RAG systems include noise in retrieval results, additional computational overhead, misalignment between retrievers and generators, increased system complexity, and challenges in handling lengthy contexts."
    },
    "RAG3": {
        "Q": "How is RAG applied across different AI modalities?", 
        "Ans": "RAG is used in various AI applications, including text generation (e.g., question answering and summarization), code generation, knowledge-based question answering, and multimodal tasks like video captioning and audio generation."
    },
    "RAG4": {
        "Q": "What are some potential future directions for RAG research?", 
        "Ans": "Future research in RAG aims to explore novel augmentation methodologies, develop more flexible RAG pipelines, broaden applications, improve deployment efficiency, incorporate real-time and long-tail knowledge, and combine RAG with other AI techniques like reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought reasoning."
    },
    "RAG5": {
        "Q": "What are the different types of retrievers used in RAG?", 
        "Ans": "RAG utilizes different retrieval methods, including sparse retrievers (e.g., BM25), dense retrievers (e.g., DPR), and hybrid approaches that combine elements of both. These retrieval mechanisms help efficiently fetch relevant information to improve content generation."

questions_HRI = {
    "HRI1": {
        "Q": "What are the four stages of competence in skill development?", 
        "Ans": "The four stages of competence are: \n- Unconscious incompetence: The learner is unaware of their lack of skill. \n- Conscious incompetence: The learner recognizes their lack of skill and its importance. \n- Conscious competence: The learner can perform the skill but requires focus and effort. \n- Unconscious competence: The skill becomes automatic, requiring little conscious thought."
    },
    "HRI2": {
        "Q": "What is the main difference between social robots and service robots?", 
        "Ans": "The main difference is that social robots are designed to interact with humans naturally, using features like speech recognition, emotions, and gestures, whereas service robots focus on performing tasks with minimal or no interaction with humans."
    },
    "HRI3": {
        "Q": "How does reinforcement learning contribute to adaptive human–robot interaction?", 
        "Ans": "Reinforcement learning helps robots adapt their behavior by interacting with humans, learning from past experiences, and adjusting responses based on observed outcomes to optimize human–robot interaction."
    },
    "HRI4": {
        "Q": "What are the advantages of using cloud computing in robotics research?", 
        "Ans": "The key advantages include: \n- Offloading computation to reduce the processing burden on robots. \n- Collective learning by sharing data and experiences across multiple robots. \n- Access to a knowledge base for retrieving pre-learned models and strategies. \n- Improved adaptability by updating models in real-time."
    },
    "HRI5": {
        "Q": "What are the main goals of the PhD thesis discussed in the document?", 
        "Ans": "The PhD thesis aims to: \n- Provide a theoretical background on human learning and cognitive stimulation therapy. \n- Explore intelligent tutoring systems and their educational applications. \n- Examine the role of social robots in education. \n- Investigate reinforcement learning methods for adaptive human–robot interaction. \n- Highlight the benefits of cloud computing in robotics."
